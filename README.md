# why

Image this. Your product manager ask you to prepare for another marketing event. You shout in your heart: "again?" You know that it is only a simple page with some background images and words for sale. You don't want to waste time on this anymore. You may think, why can't these product managers code for themselves. It's just changing background image or words. 

Yes, they can. All you need is this. A GUI for generating json API. It's based on the simple and friendly forms. Even though they don't know what json is, they can easily edit, add or delete items of this json api. All you need is to create a json schema for the page. 

Then, they can just click publish button to make the magic happen. You don't need to create a operating system for them. Just a simple editable json api is all you need.

Another scene is about config file. We often need some configure files for our system such as the scheduled tasks. It's hard to create a whole system for editing config file. With json-api-generator, you can easily create a config file for your system and it can be changeable anytime as you wish.
